## Unleash the Power of Declarative Modals

Welcome to a world where modals become an effortless part of your user interface. Declarative Modal JS brings you a groundbreaking approach to displaying modals without the hassle of managing visibility states. Craft complex logic, prompt user inputs, or confirm actions seamlessly within your application flow. Our library is designed to supercharge your development process, offering a headless core that allows complete customization.

### Key Features

- üåç **Framework Agnostic Core**: Developed with Vanilla JS, Declarative Modal supports adapters for popular librarys including React, Svelte and in the near future, Solid, and Qwik.
- üì¶ **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Support**: Fully supported SSR capabilities.
- üîí **Type-Safe Show Functions**: Strict typing for show functions enables bidirectional communication between the modal and its caller, allowing for endless possibilities of generic logic without embedding specific business logic.
- üí® **Lightweight & Zero Dependencies**: With a focus on native APIs, the library boasts an small footprint (~2kb) with no external dependencies.
- üé® **Headless UI Construction**: Freedom to build your UI with any animation, style, or configuration without being confined by complicated props or configurations.
- üåÄ **Inclusivity of Basic Animations**: While basic animations are provided, you have the liberty to animate your modals as much as you wish.
- üõ† **Versatile Core**: Beyond modals, use the core to create popups, tooltips, sidebars, menus, and whatever else your project requires.
