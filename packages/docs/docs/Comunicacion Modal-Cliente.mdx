import Highlight from '../src/components/Hightlist';

# Modal-Client Communication

All views invoked with the show method create an internal channel for exchanging information in both directions.

# Default Configuration

#### ShowMethod
By default, the showMethod returns a promise that resolves as soon as the view returns its first message. This behavior can be overridden so that the promise resolves instantly after showing the modal, using the <Highlight>wait</Highlight> property.

#### CloseModal
By default, the first argument of closeModal will be the response that the modal will return, and this response will be sent instantly. You can override this behavior so that the message is sent once the modal finishes closing correctly, i.e., after the animations are complete, using the <Highlight>waitAnimation</Highlight> property.
<br/>
You can set these properties in the following ways:
```tsx
// Specific configuration at a specific moment
showMethod(...modalProps, { wait: false, waitAnimation: false })
```
```tsx
// General configuration
generateModal({Modals: {/*...MyModals*/}, wait: false, waitAnimation: false})
```
:::tip
They are ordered according to their priority, meaning one method can override the other
:::

# Listen for messages

The showMethod returns a <Highlight>waitFor</Highlight> function, which is also found within the modal's props. When invoked, it returns a promise that will wait until the modal returns a message. This promise can be aborted for two reasons: you can configure a timeout, or call the <Highlight>abort</Highlight> method of the promise itself. You can use this waitFor to wait for responses from the modal, or in the modal itself to have the client send you data.

```tsx
const { waitFor } = await showMethod()

// Wait for a message
const response = await waitFor()

// Wait for a message for a maximum of 1 second
waitFor({timeout: 1000 })

// Abort with the abort method
const waitForPromise = waitFor()
waitForPromise.abort()
```
:::info
An infinite number of messages can be received.
:::

# Send messages

Like the waitFor function, the modal props and the showMethod response have a sendMessage function, which can be used to send messages in both directions, Modal -> Client or Client -> Modal.

```tsx
// Client
const { sendMessage } = await showMethod()
sendMessage(myMessage)

// Modal
sendMessage(myMessage)
```
